# Data Strucutures and Algorithms in Rust and JavaScript

## This Repository is for two purposes.
1. To Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
2. To Learn Rust and how it should be used.

## Procedure:

1. Write the algorithm first in JavaScript/NodeJS
2. Then write the algorithm in Rust
3. Use `cargomon` or `nodemon` to run the programs
